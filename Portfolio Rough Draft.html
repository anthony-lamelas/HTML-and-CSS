        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi, my name is Anthony Lamelas and I am currently an Electrical and Computer Engineering student at New York University’s Tandon School of Engineering expecting to graduate in 2027. I am a creative individual who is passionate about new technology and innovation. I have launched my own business, tutored and mentored kids, and led academic projects. I am always trying to become more involved on campus and learn new skills.</p>

        <h2 class="project-tile">Window Warden</h2>
        <h3>My Role</h3>
        <ul class="role-list">
            <li>Devised the idea to create an automated window-cleaning robot.</li>
            <li>Created a precise and accurate Computer Aided Design (CAD) model using Autodesk Fusion 360.</li>
            <li>Created the circuit diagram and circuit schematic for the robot using Tinkercad.</li>
            <li>Assembled the circuit for the robot which contained a water pump, two DC motors, an ultrasonic sensor, an Arduino UNO, a breadboard, batteries, and a motor driver.</li>
            <li>Laser cut the entire shell using Epilog Laser Cutters. This comprised of the outer shell with incisions to allow wires to pass through as well as an inner box to house the circuitry.</li>
            <li>Worked with team members to assemble the robot.</li>
            <li>Programmed the basic movement of the robot’s motors in Arduino IDE.</li>
            <li>Created multiple PowerPoint presentations to explain the robot's progress during the semester.</li>
            <li>Wrote a 35-page final design report describing the prototype.</li>
            <li>Placed in the top fourteen of all of the EG classes.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Results</h3>
        <p>The Window Warden proved successful as my teammates and I benchmarked successfully and submitted our project early. The project proved to be a great achievement as it was one of fourteen selected to participate in the RAD showcase. At the showcase, our team created a poster board and presented the Window Warden to faculty, teaching assistants, and other students. We placed in the top 14 when compared to all of the EG-1004 classes.</p>
