<header><h2>If Statements</h2></header>

<p>An if statement in programming is a fundamental control structure that allows for conditional execution of code based on a specified condition. It's commonly used to create decision-making processes within a program.</p>

<p>If statements can also be combined with else and elif (else if) statements to create more complex decision structures. The else statement allows for the execution of code when the if condition is false, while elif statements provide additional conditions to check if the initial if condition is false. </p>

<code>
                if condition:<br>
                    <p class="tabbed"># Code block executed when condition is true<br>
                    statement1<br>
                    statement2<br>
                    ...<br></p>
            </code>

 <header><h2>For Loops</h2></header>

 <p>For loops are fundamental constructs in programming used for iterating over a sequence of elements or executing a block of code a specified number of times. They provide a convenient way to automate repetitive tasks and process collections of data.</p>

<p>For loops are fundamental constructs in programming used for iterating over a sequence of elements or executing a block of code a specified number of times. They provide a convenient way to automate repetitive tasks and process collections of data. The syntax of a for loop typically includes the keyword "for" followed by a variable that represents each element in the sequence or the number of iterations.</p>

<h3>Most Common Uses:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Iterating Over Collections</li>
<li>Known Number of Iterations</li>
<li>Looping with Increment or Decrement</li>
  </ul>

<code>
                for item in iterable:<br>
                    <p class="tabbed"># Code block executed for each item in iterable<br>
                    statement1<br>
                    statement2<br>
                    ...</p>
            </code>

  <section class="main-section" id="while_loops">
  <header><h2>While Loops</h2></header>
  <p>While loops are a fundamental programming construct used for repetitive execution of code as long as a specified condition remains true. Unlike for loops, which iterate over a predefined sequence or range, while loops continue executing as long as the specified condition evaluates to true.  </p>

<p>While loops are versatile tools for creating dynamic and flexible code structures, especially when the number of iterations is not predetermined or when iterative execution depends on changing conditions.</p>

<h3>Most Common Uses:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Looping Based on Condition</li>
<li>Dynamic Iteration</li>
<li>Complex Conditional Logic</li>
  </ul>



<code>
                while condition:<br>
                    <p class="tabbed"># Code block executed as long as condition is true<br>
                    statement1<br>
                    statement2<br>
                    ...</p>

  <section class="main-section" id="functions">
  <header><h2>Functions</h2></header>

  <p>Functions are essential building blocks in programming that encapsulate a set of instructions or tasks into a reusable unit. They allow developers to break down complex logic into manageable and modular components, promoting code organization, readability, and reusability.</p>

<p>Functions promote code modularity and abstraction by allowing developers to create reusable blocks of code that can be called and executed multiple times from different parts of a program. They also help in organizing code into smaller, more manageable units, enhancing code readability, maintainability, and debugging.</p>

<code>
                def function_name(parameters):<br>
                    <p class="tabbed"># Function definition<br>
                    statement1<br>
                    statement2<br>
                    ...<br>
                    return value</p>
            </code>

  </section>

<section class="main-section" id="classes">
<header><h2>Classes</h2></header>

<p>Classes are fundamental constructs in object-oriented programming that allow developers to create blueprints for objects. They encapsulate data (attributes) and behaviors (methods) into a single unit, promoting code reusability, modularity, and maintainability. The syntax of defining a class typically involves using the keyword "class" followed by the class name, a set of attributes and methods enclosed in curly braces, and optionally a constructor method.</p>


<p>Classes also support inheritance, allowing one class (subclass) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (superclass). This concept promotes code reuse and hierarchy in object-oriented programming, enabling developers to create specialized classes that inherit functionality from more general classes.</p>
<code>
                class ClassName:<br>
                    <p class="tabbed"># Class definition<br>
                    def __init__(self, parameters):<br>
                        # Constructor method<br>
                        self.attribute = value<br>
                    def method_name(self, parameters):<br>
                        # Method definition<br>
                        statement1<br>
                        statement2<br>
                        ...</p>
            </code>
